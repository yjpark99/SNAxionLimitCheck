# SN Axion Limit Check

Two checks on the SN axion emission and resulting limits.

In the notebook Analysis.ipynb, we show three cases of obtaining the 95% upper limit. First, we show the estimate of the upper limit on $g_{a \gamma \gamma}$ from Primakoff emission of our fiducial SN model without time binning information. Then, we show our full analysis in obtaining this upper limit for our fiducial analysis, which includes time binning, profiling over backgrounds, and using all energy bins. Finally, we show the resulting upper limit when bremsstrahlung axion emission is also factored into the spectra, resulting in the upper limit that appears as the solid blue line of Fig. 1 in 2405.19393. 

In the notebook AxionSpectrum.ipynb, we compare the axion emission spectrum from the Primakoff production mechanism as calculated in [2405.19393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393) to the digitized data of hot SN model and cold SN model. The peak of the spectrum, $dN/dE$ [1/MeV] seem to differ by a factor of ~1.5 for the two cases.
